### Session Observations

- Initial project setup session
- User (ara) has deep background in Ruby (143 gems) - values simplicity and consistency
- Strong preference for M-theory metaphors (Brane, Calabi)
- Wants REPL-first development approach

### Pending Clarifications

- CozoDB: Need to verify Bun.js bindings exist and are stable
- tc: Need to locate/install the tc test runner

### Patterns Noticed

- User provides detailed context via pasted conversations (e.g., Gemini chat)
- Prefers comprehensive documentation before implementation
- Values "hacker aesthetic" - short names, Unix-style paths

### Technical Debt Identified

- (none yet - project just initialized)

### Next Session Prep

- Ready to implement Phase 1: REPL + sys.call skeleton
- May need to research CozoDB-Bun integration
